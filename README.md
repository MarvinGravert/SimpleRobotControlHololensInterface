# SimpleRobotControlHololensInterface
A small little unity project which will implement a interface to modify a robot path.

This project uses MRTK V2.1 which can be found here. https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases

Goal is the creation of a simple interface that moves a qube based off simple move commands by the user. A rudimentary menu shall also be provided.

This will be used as a first test for the final realisation later.
